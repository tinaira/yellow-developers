Title: Server configuration
---
Here's how to set up different [web servers](https://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey/).

## Apache

The `.htaccess` configuration file for the [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org) web server:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on

DirectoryIndex index.html yellow.php
RewriteRule ^(cache|content|system)/ error [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^ yellow.php [L]
</IfModule>
```

When your website doesn't work, please check the following steps. Add `RewriteBase` to the configuration file, this will fix most Apache web server problems. Here's an example for a subfolder:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /yellow/
DirectoryIndex index.html yellow.php
RewriteRule ^(cache|content|system)/ error [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^ yellow.php [L]
</IfModule>
```

Here's an example for a subdomain:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /
DirectoryIndex index.html yellow.php
RewriteRule ^(cache|content|system)/ error [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^ yellow.php [L]
</IfModule>
```


When your website still doesn't work, please check the Apache web server. If you use a selfhosted web server, you probably have to enable the [rewrite module](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/869092/how-to-enable-mod-rewrite-for-apache-2-2) and configure `AllowOverride All` in the [web server settings](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18740419/how-to-set-allowoverride-all). 

Make sure that the web server can read and write files. You can manually adjust [file permissions](http://superuser.com/questions/51838/recursive-chmod-rw-for-files-rwx-for-directories) so that the web server can overwrite files, for example with command `chmod -R a+rw *`. As an alternative you can assign the group `www-data` and `umask 002` to the web server and users.

## Nginx

The `nginx.conf` configuration file for the [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) web server:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name website.com;
    root /var/www/website/;
    index index.html yellow.php;

    location /cache {
        rewrite ^(.*)$ /error break;
    }

    location /content {
        rewrite ^(.*)$ /error break;
    }

    location /system {
        rewrite ^(.*)$ /error break;
    }

    location / {
        if (!-e $request_filename) {
            rewrite ^/(.*)$ /yellow.php last;
            break;
        }
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
        fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
        fastcgi_index yellow.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

When your website doesn't work, please check `server_name` and `root` in the configuration file. If the configuration file has been changed, you need to [restart/reload](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21292533/reload-nginx-configuration) the Nginx web server.

Make sure that the web server can read and write files. You can manually adjust [file permissions](http://superuser.com/questions/51838/recursive-chmod-rw-for-files-rwx-for-directories) so that the web server can overwrite files, for example with command `chmod -R a+rw *`. As an alternative you can assign the group `www-data` and `umask 002` to the web server and users.

## Dynamic website

If you want to test a dynamic website, use the built-in web server. This is especially handy for developers, since everything runs on your own computer. With this philosophy you completely bypass any web server problem.

You can start the built-in web server from the [command line](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/command):

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Go to your installation folder, where the `yellow.php` is.
3. Type the following line: `php -S localhost:8000 yellow.php`

The website is available as `http://localhost:8000`.

## Static website

If you want to create a static website, use the static site generator. This is done by running a build command from within the installation folder. It generates a static website, that works on any decent web server.

You can create a static website from the [command line](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/command):

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Go to your installation folder, where the `yellow.php` is.
3. Type the following line: `php yellow.php build /var/www/website`

This will build a static website in folder `/var/www/website`. Upload the folder to your web hosting and build a new version when needed. The URL can be defined in the [system settings](adjusting-system#system-settings), for example `StaticUrl: http://website/`.

As an alternative to a static website you can build a cache. This will speed up your website, but the cache has to be updated repeatedly. Here's an example: `php yellow.php build`. To clean the cache type the following line: `php yellow.php clean`.

When your static website doesn't work, please check the web server configuration. Configure your web server to send no default MIME type or the MIME type `text/html`, when it can't detect the file type.

## Error page

When there are problems an error page is shown. When a web browser requests a file that the web server doesn't find, your website will show an error page with “File not found”. The file `system/config/page-error-404.txt` defines how this error page looks like:

~~~~
---
Title: File not found
---
The requested file was not found. Oh no...
~~~~

Usually there's nothing more to do. If you create a static website with Datenstrom Yellow, there's one additional step. Configure your web server to display your custom error page. 

For [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org) add the following line to your configuration file:

    ErrorDocument 404 /404.html

For [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) add the following line to your configuration file:

    error_page 404 /404.html;
